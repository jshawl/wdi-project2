## Project Workflow

**Exceeds Expectations** 

Fantastic Readme!! I think using TDD is a great idea in the future, or
spending more time upfront planning like you discussed. The unsolved problems will be super useful
to you in the future and for potential employers to see your thought process. Let me know if you'd like
to work through any of those together.

## Technical Requirements

**Exceeds Expectations**

Awesome job implementing *seven* models! Your CSS codebase is quite complex, but it's great to see you
tackle more front-end concerns like the user experience. Consider scheduling time to write tests either at
the beginning, during or end of your next project.

## Creativity / Interface

**Exceeds Expectations**

Really awesome job making this app your own! There are several features in this app that would
benefit from adding tooltips or helpful info - like tagging something more than once, rules on downvoting, etc..

## Deployment and Functionality

**Meets Expectations**

Please rename the URL of your deployed app: `heroku rename newnamehere`. I was unable to produce any errors
on the deployed application. The only issue I had was with double tagging - Tags I created were deleted, while
others were double tagged when clicked.
